About the project:

Linear Regression
Originally I had a dataset..

Web scrapping
I made web srapping but i did not merge datasets because movies in a new datatset are very new that is why we lack a lot of scores and it results in N/a in many rows. If I had to merge these 2 datasets i would need to clean all Nan values and it ould result in a very small new dataset.
