In this project, I explored the performance of various machine learning algorithms using the same dataset. Initially, I employed logistic regression and support vector classification (SVC). Recently, I implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to further enhance the model's performance metrics.

For this analysis, I utilized cancer-related data, which I cleaned before applying the KNN algorithm. The results yielded high accuracy, achieving 95%. Additionally, I incorporated visualizations to better understand the data distribution and clustering patterns.

The dataset exhibited an imbalance in class distribution. To address this issue, I experimented with oversampling and undersampling techniques. However, despite these attempts, there was no noticeable improvement in the model's metrics.
