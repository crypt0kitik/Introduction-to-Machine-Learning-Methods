Hello here!

old -

I used some of these datasets for the linear and logistic regression, but I opted to try SVM as well on these datasets to see if I could achieve better metric results using different methods of optimization. If you see "old -" in the folder name, it means that this dataset was used in other ML alorythms and I try to improve metrics.

I also added new dataset and experimented with them a bit.
